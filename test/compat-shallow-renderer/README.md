# test/compat-shallow-renderer

Most/many of tests in this directory are taken from Enzyme's
`react-shallow-renderer`. Test files that are taken from that repo include a
comment at the top of the file indicating such. These test files have been
modified to be TypeScript, formatted to this repo's formatting standards, and
updated to match which features Preact updates (i.e. tests asserting features
Preact doesn't support are skipped).
